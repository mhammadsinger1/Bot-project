# Bot-project
Programming and Algorithms course

This course was my first project, took me from theory into practice. I implemented DFS to traverse the cells, and BFS for once I am stuck between true neighbors, I
can reach the closest unvisitd False cell. I skip 2 rows at a time.
Code file name project_v1.1, then go to file with name: Bot936910.py
