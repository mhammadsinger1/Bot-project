# Bot-project
Programming and Algorithms course

This course was my first project, took me from theory into practice. I implemented DFS to traverse the cells, and BFS for once I am stuck between true neighbors, I
can reach the closest unvisitd False cell. I skip 2 rows at a time.

# WEb-scraper
when i came to the netherlands i was homeless. I did this webscraper to be the first informed about new listings. Luckily I did not have to use it, but i completed it regardless. This was my first project and was purely a beginner with my bachelor in business.
